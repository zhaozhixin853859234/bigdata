Fires are potentially the most destructive natural disaster in forested areas [ 1 , 2 ] that burn millions
of hectares annually [ 3 , 4 ] and are responsible for the loss of biodiversity, soil quality, and CO 2
capture [ 5 ]. The susceptibility of the forests and their adjacent areas, i.e., human settlements and
infrastructures, to fires is a major concern to the communities in many land ecosystems of the
world [ 6 – 12 ]. Increased changes in socioeconomic processes and climate that induced extensive
modification of natural environment [ 13 , 14 ] and prolonged drought periods [ 15 – 19 ] have placed strong
demands on authorities and decision makers to temporally and spatially delineate the forested areas in
terms of susceptibility to fires [ 6 , 11 , 20 ]. Identifying areas with high/very high fire susceptibility must be

Tothisend, robustapproachesandtoolsarerequiredtoenablethemanagersandengineerstoaccurately
estimate the time, location, and extent of future fires [ 8 , 10 , 12 , 27 – 29 ]. The improvements in techniques
for predicting fire susceptibility and delineating the forested areas into different susceptibility levels
can help forest managers and policy makers to achieve a better understanding of fires that facilitates
the development of prevention measures for the fire-prone forests [4,30].
In forest fire prediction, however, it is difficult to compile sufficient amounts of spatially explicit
geo-environmental data, particularly over large-scale forests, due to field survey difficulties and
budgetary constraints. Over the past decade, machine learning methods have successfully reached
the primacy as a replacement to the traditional field-survey methods for the prediction of forest fire
susceptibility by elucidating the relationship between historic fire events and different explanatory
variables in order to predict future fires [20]. Examples for machine learning methods suggested and
used for forest fire prediction include decision tree based classifiers [ 31 , 32 ], artificial neural network
(ANN) [33,34], neuro-fuzzy [27,35–37], and support vector machine [7,33,38].
